            <p>Privacy is a right. It is something that cannot be compromised. In today’s age, people use the internet on a daily basis, whether that be for casual browsing, or important tasks like banking or stocks. However, most users don’t consider while
                going through their day-to-day tasks what information is being tracked, nor how much of their data is being shared online. This is by design. It is in the interests of companies not to reveal the extent to which their consumer’s behavior
                is used to inform business and development decisions. Sometimes one thinks of something they want to purchase and when they open their phone or go to some website, they see an advertisement on exactly what they were thinking about. This
                has been reported numerous times. This phenomenon is due to frequent tracking, and by extension a frequent violation of privacy rights. A study done on the role of User Privacy Concerns in Shaping Competition shows that companies trying
                to advertise to the user are exposing the user to unforeseen risks such as data breaches or leakages [5]. Among Platforms Privacy gets overlooked very often, for example, users do not have access to their data and what is being tracked
                by websites, companies, and applications. The user doesn’t even know what information is being tracked.

            <p>Everyone deserves to be able to see what is going on behind the scenes. As increasing portions of daily life start to take place online, privacy becomes a huge concern-- more data becomes available for companies to use and sell to others.
                Websites do not ask for permission to track your information; they just do it. Research teams have found that first or third-party tracking of user data is present in over 90% of the 500 most popular sites. [4] Trackers are even embedded
                in emails, often without informing the user at all. [3] There must be more information given to the user, as well as making websites and applications need to ask for permissions to track the user’s data. There are some checks built into
                browsers or operating systems, where an application must ask permission to track the user’s information, location, and data. However, even when one disallows tracking, apps and websites often continue to relay certain information to the
                companies that created them, or their affiliates. Presently there is no sure way for the average user to tell whether an app has completely stopped tracking their information. People want to be private, and they are conscious about their
                decisions when given an option. For example, a study was done at University of California about location privacy and the results told that when given the option users were very aware about their decisions; “However, a significant number
                of users denied location access to more than half of the apps that requested it, and one user denied location access to every app that requested it… Our data suggests that users are not reflexively clicking OK to grant location access
                to every application that requests it” [1]. Privacy is a thing we hold dear and when things leak it becomes a major problem. Studies have shown that users are cognizant about their actions and will use the options about what they want
                to share or not [1]. Privacy is a right that everyone deserves and that is exactly why it needs more focus. With more things taking place online and, on the cloud, users need to be more in control of their information. Furthermore, companies
                are taking information from the user that is not part of the fair information principles. Companies fail to comply with the policies and there is not much the user can do about it. In a research paper examining internet privacy policies
                within the context of user privacy values, a study was conducted on various websites and the results were: “However, our content analytical research found many website statements that lie outside of the FIP principles [14]; in fact, we
                developed seven categories of statements that we term vulnerabilities to users in that they pose potential invasions of privacy” [2]. The research paper shows that companies disregard the privacy policies and take any information they
                want. This is a major problem for the user and everyone knows that introducing new laws and implementing them takes a long time. There needs to be a solution to stop companies from taking the users data without consent. Additionally, there
                was a repeal in the privacy policies from FCC [15] in 2017 that would have helped the users' information stay private by making companies ask permission before taking any information [6]. The policy makers are not in the favor of the user.
                In order to preserve the right to privacy there needs to be a solution that gives the user control over their privacy.
