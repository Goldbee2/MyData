            <p><span class=accent-text>Privacy is a right. </span>It is something that cannot be compromised. In today’s age, people use the internet on a daily basis, whether that be for casual browsing, or important tasks like banking or stocks. However,
                most users don’t consider while going through their day-to-day tasks what information is being tracked, nor how much of their data is being shared online. This is by design.</p>
            <p> It is in the interests of companies not to reveal the extent to which their consumer’s behavior is used to inform business and development decisions. When a user sees an advertisement for something they were just thinking about, the advertiser
                doesn't want you to know they've targeted that advertisement to you from a huge agglommeration of your own personal information. Worse, this data is mishandled often. Companies accidentally expose their users private information, making
                you vulnerable to fraud, identity theft, and other cyber-crimes.</p>
            <p>Privacy gets overlooked or ignored often. Users typically do not have easy access to honest information about if or how they are tracked.
                <span class="accent-text">That's where we come in.</span> Mydata provides the user with valuable information about suspicious online practices. We tell you who's tracking you, and what they use the data for. We put tools in your hands
                to defend yourself from non-consensual commodification.</p>

        <div id=about-trackers>
            <h3 class="gradient-text section-header">About Trackers</h3>
        </div>
        <p><span class="accent-text">ISP Tracking:</span> A user’s Internet Service Provider (ISP) is keeping track of everything you do online. For most people, knowing the government could view our online activity probably doesn't seem too scary. But if
            you live under an oppressive government, even seemingly innocent online activity can be very dangerous. Plus, in an era of almost-daily data breaches, assuming your information is safe with anyone is naive at best. Even ISPs can be affected.
            So take a moment and think about everything your ISP could potentially know about you. Maybe you use BitTorrent to download the occasional copyrighted song or movie. Maybe you've been viewing sites you would prefer your family not know about.
            Browsing history should stay private. Blocking the data an ISP views is one of the most essential ways of protecting yourself.</p>

        <p><span class="accent-text">Advertisement Tracking:</span> Online ad tracking is the process of gathering data and insights about the performance of online advertising campaigns. By using cookies, unique tracking URLs, tracking pixels, and other
            methods, companies can collect data about how people interact with their ad campaigns across the internet. This data is then analyzed for market and customer insights and used for targeted advertising. Companies track you online for many reasons,
            a lot of them well-intentioned. Online tracking is often used to serve you better content, show you ads for things that you’re likely to be interested in, offer relevant or localized news or weather updates, and so on. All this generally improves
            your online experience. But online tracking also, of course, underpins the online ad economy. Most free websites make money by selling ads, and the most successful ads tend to be targeted. Today, thanks to the wealth of data added to the internet
            daily, online tracking is big business. User’s actions and opinions are being used for their likeness with nothing in return.</p>
        <p><span class="accent-text">Location Tracking:</span>Location tracking refers to technologies that physically locate and electronically record and track the movement of people or objects. Location tracking technology is in use every day with GPS
            navigation, locations located on digital pictures and searching for businesses nearby using common apps. While location tracking is often associated with smartphone use since smartphones have a GPS chip, there are other ways location tracking
            is done. Additional uses for location tracking include wearable gadgets and apps for parents to track their kids and for law enforcement tracking offenders. The cameras you see at red lights, the cell phone in your pocket, and activity monitors
            all have some location tracking capability, which makes the tracking of people's locations and every move a debated privacy issue as well. The major concern about the use of location data is that it might be linked back to an individual. That’s
            why anonymization is key. But to eliminate every way in which individuals can be identified is a technically complex task – especially when it comes to location.

            <h3 class="gradient-text section-header">State of the Web</h3>
            <p>Everyone deserves to be able to see what is going on behind the scenes. As increasing portions of daily life start to take place online, privacy becomes a huge concern-- more data becomes available for companies to use and sell to others.
                Websites do not ask for permission to track your information; they just do it. </p>
            <p><span class=accent-text>Research teams have found that first or third-party tracking of user data is present in over 90% of the 500 most popular sites.</span> Trackers are even embedded in emails, often without informing the user at all. [3]
                There must be more information given to the user, as well as making websites and applications need to ask for permissions to track the user’s data. There are some checks built into browsers or operating systems, where an application must
                ask permission to track the user’s information, location, and data. However, even when one disallows tracking, apps and websites often continue to relay certain information to the companies that created them, or their affiliates. Presently
                there is no sure way for the average user to tell whether an app has completely stopped tracking their information.</p>
            <p> People want to be private, and they are conscious about their decisions when given an option. For example, a study was done at University of California about location privacy and the results told that when given the option users were very
                aware about their decisions; “A significant number of users denied location access to more than half of the apps that requested it, and one user denied location access to every app that requested it… Our data suggests that users are not
                reflexively clicking OK to grant location access to every application that requests it”.

            </p>
            <p>Companies fail to comply with the policies and there is not much the user can do about it. In a research paper examining internet privacy policies within the context of user privacy values, a study was conducted on various websites and the
                results were: “However, our content analytical research found many website statements that lie outside of the FIP principles [14]; in fact, we developed seven categories of statements that we term vulnerabilities to users in that they
                pose potential invasions of privacy”. The research paper shows that companies disregard the privacy policies and take any information they want. This is a major problem for the user and everyone knows that introducing new laws and implementing
                them takes a long time.</p>
            <p> There needs to be a solution to stop companies from taking the users data without consent. Additionally, there was a repeal in the privacy policies from FCC [15] in 2017 that would have helped the users' information stay private by making
                companies ask permission before taking any information. The policy makers are not in the favor of the user. In order to preserve the right to privacy there needs to be a solution that gives the user control over their privacy.
